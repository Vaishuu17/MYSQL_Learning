### Day 1 – SQL Basics

A clean start to mastering SQL — one query at a time.


* What I Practiced Today :

Understanding databases & tables

Basic SELECT statements

Filtering using WHERE

Sorting using ORDER BY

Limiting results with LIMIT

Simple conditions (AND, OR, comparison operators)


* Concepts Covered :

| Concept       | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| **SELECT**    | Retrieve data from a table |
| **WHERE**     | Apply filters to rows      |
| **ORDER BY**  | Sort results ASC/DESC      |
| **LIMIT**     | Restrict number of rows    |
| **Operators** | =, <, >, <=, >=, AND, OR   |


* Key Takeaways :

SQL is simple when you understand patterns

Queries follow a clean structure:
SELECT → FROM → WHERE → ORDER BY → LIMIT

Use comments (-- like this) to make queries readable

Practicing daily builds strong muscle memory

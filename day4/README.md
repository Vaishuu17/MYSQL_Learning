Day 4 – SQL Learning Journey
## GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

This repository documents Day 4 of my SQL learning journey, where I focused on understanding how to group data and apply conditions on aggregated results using GROUP BY and HAVING.

These concepts are fundamental for data analysis, reporting, and SQL interviews.

## Topics Covered
GROUP BY

Groups rows with the same values in specified columns

## Commonly used with aggregate functions:

COUNT()

SUM()

AVG()

MIN()

MAX()

HAVING

Filters grouped data after aggregation

Used when conditions involve aggregate functions

## Key difference:

WHERE filters rows before grouping

HAVING filters groups after aggregation

## Key Learnings

SQL execution order with GROUP BY

Why HAVING is required instead of WHERE for aggregate conditions

Writing clean and optimized aggregation queries

Avoiding common GROUP BY mistakes
